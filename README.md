The hashed password cracker tool will be designed to crack hashed passwords often used for secure storage and authentication. It will utilize various techniques such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table lookups to attempt to reverse-engineer the original password from its hash value. 

The cracker will provide a user-friendly interface for inputting hashed passwords and will employ advanced algorithms and optimization techniques to increase efficiency and speed. The project aims to assist users in recovering forgotten passwords or testing the strength of their hashed password implementations.
